\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose that $A,B,C$ are rings and $\varphi : A \to B$ and $\psi: B \to C$ are ring homomorphisms. Prove that $\psi\circ\varphi: A \to C$ is a ring homomorphism. How are $\ker \varphi$ and $\ker(\psi\circ\varphi)$ related?

\item Consider the set $I$ consisting of all polynomials $a_0+a_1x+\dotsm\in\Z[x]$ whose constant term (i.e., the integer $a_0$) is {\em even}. Show that $I$ is an ideal of $\Z[x]$ and the quotient ring $\Z[x]/I$ is isomorphic to $\Z/2\Z$. 

({\em Suggestion}: Apply the First Isomorphism Theorem to a homomorphism $\Z[x]\to\Z/2\Z$ defined as a composition of homomorphisms $\Z[x]\to\Z$ and $\Z\to\Z/2\Z$; this approach eliminates a lot of tedious checking.)

\item Do the following problems from Section 7.3 in the textbook:
\begin{itemize}
\item \#1 ({\em Hint}: Which integers satisfy $a^2=2a$?)
\item \#7 ({\em Note}: The ring operations on the direct product $\Z\times\Z$ are defined componentwise, i.e., $(a,d)+(a',d')=(a+a',d+d')$ and $(a,d)\cdot(a',d')=(aa',dd')$.)
\item \#18
\item \#20
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
